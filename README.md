# Guided Project: Exploring Hacker News Posts

## Project Overview:

In this project, we'll compare two different types of posts from Hacker News, a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. 
The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.

We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
